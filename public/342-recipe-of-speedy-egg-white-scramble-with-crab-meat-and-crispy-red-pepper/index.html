<h5 id="steps-to-make-egg-white-scramble-with-crab-meat-and-crispy-red-pepper">Steps to make Egg white scramble with crab meat and crispy red pepper:</h5>
<ol>
<li>This was the last of my crab meat. It weighed 2.5 ounces so that's what's going in this scramble</li>
<li>1/2 cup of liquid egg whites more protein</li>
<li>Veggies and bacon bits why because I need flavor</li>
<li>Garlic powder about 1/2 tsp</li>
<li>Fresh ground pepper to taste</li>
<li>Heat up a non stick ceramic skillet, you cannot use cooking spray on these or the coating is destroyed.</li>

<p>Stir egg yolk, remaining eggs, salt, and pepper into cream cheese mixture; fold in red pepper and onion. Since it was more brunch time than breakfast; next time will have crab-meat or salad shrimp in the scramble. With a hand mixer whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper and tomato puree. Heat the butter in a pan and scramble the egg mixture. When it comes to scrambled eggs, I look for the eggs to be soft and creamy.</p>
